Hello world!

Ever since I started learning, there is a huge passion for teaching started growing inside me. I always wanted to teach others what I learn. I taught few around me about JS and React but I believe there are still more people who need guidance in approaching new technologies. That gives birth to this blog.

I always wanted to have a blog but it took me this much time to get the ball rolling due to my busy schedule (or I'm too lazy to get started :p) Anyways finally its here. From now on, whatever I learn, be it a small concept like arrow function or more complex concepts like closures or prototypes, I'm going to share with you.

(Shhh...... I'm going to share with only you. Yeah! Only you. Not to everyone. Lucky you! ;))

If you would like to read an article on some topic or if you would like to send me some feedback/love, feel free to drop a message to [me](mailto:ambatikirankumar4@gmail.com) ! Happy Learning!
